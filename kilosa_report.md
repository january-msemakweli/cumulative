## 2. Frequency Distribution of Conditions

Understanding the prevalence of different eye conditions is crucial for planning future eye camps and allocating resources effectively. The following analysis provides insights into the most common eye health issues affecting the Kilosa community.

### 2.1 General Frequency Distribution

**Note:** Condition counts are higher than the number of procedures because:
- Each patient has two eyes (right and left), and conditions are counted separately for each eye
- Some individuals had more than one diagnosis in the same eye (e.g., "Cataracts; Pterygium"), and each condition is counted separately
- Therefore, the frequency represents the total number of condition occurrences across all eyes, not the number of unique patients

#### Chart: Top 10 Conditions by Gender Comparison

![Gender Comparison](kilosa_chart_gender_comparison.png)

**Gender-Based Insights:**
- **Higher female participation** in the eye camp reflects women's greater health-seeking behavior, which is a positive pattern observed in many healthcare settings. This does not indicate disparities in access, but rather demonstrates that women are more likely to seek medical care when needed.
- **Cataracts** showed a higher prevalence in males (57.96% of male conditions) compared to females (48.44% of female conditions), though females had more total cataract occurrences (280 vs 284) due to higher overall female participation.
- **Pterygium** was significantly more common in females (19.72% of female conditions) compared to males (11.84% of male conditions), suggesting potential gender-specific risk factors or exposure patterns.
- **Presbyopia** (age-related near vision loss) was more prevalent in females (7.79%) than males (6.73%), which reflects both differences in health-seeking behavior and age distribution.
- These patterns highlight the importance of understanding health-seeking behaviors and ensuring that outreach efforts encourage all community members to access eye care services.

---

### 4.2 Frequency Distribution of Conditions by Age Groups

**Methodology:** Patients were categorized into four age groups based on their age at the time of the eye camp: 19-40 years (young adults), 41-60 years (middle-aged), 61-80 years (older adults), and 81+ years (elderly). Conditions were counted separately for each eye (right and left) within each age group, similar to the gender analysis. This allows for comparison of condition prevalence across different age demographics. The analysis includes all condition occurrences across both eyes, meaning if a patient had multiple conditions in the same eye or conditions in both eyes, each occurrence was counted separately.

#### Chart: Top 10 Conditions by Age Group Comparison

![Age Group Comparison](kilosa_chart_age_comparison.png)

**Age-Based Insights:**
- **Cataracts** showed a clear age-related pattern, with prevalence increasing dramatically with age. The older age groups had the highest cataract burden, reflecting the progressive nature of this condition.
- **Pterygium** was more common in younger to middle-aged groups, likely related to occupational and environmental exposures over time.
- The age distribution of conditions provides valuable information for preventive care strategies and resource planning for future eye camps.
